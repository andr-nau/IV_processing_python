# IV_processing_python
Processing of experimental IV (current-voltage) data - rescaling, centering, switch from I-V to R-I (resistance-current) presentation. 

My Python project for learning and testing its functionality.

iv1.txt and iv57.txt - experimental raw data for test (different shapes of IV)

There are versions dedicated for Python's IDEs (e.g. Spider, to see graphs and outputs) and Jupiter notebook.

Sample result in graphical form:

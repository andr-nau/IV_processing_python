# IV_processing_python
Processing of experimental IV (current-voltage) data - rescaling, centering, switch from I-V to R-I (resistance-current) presentation. 

My Python project for learning and testing its functionality.

iv1.txt and iv57.txt - experimental raw data for test (different shapes of IV)

This is version dedicated for Python's IDEs, like Spider (to see graphs and outputs).
